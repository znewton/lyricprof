# LyricProf
A web app that checks song lyrics for possible FCC profanity violations.

## Reason for Creation
My friend, a radio DJ at KURE, thought it would be very handy to have a site that allows you to search a song to quickly check for profanity instead of having to go through the tedious and error prone task of scanning each line yourself. It finally became a reality at HackISU Fall 2016!

## Use Cases
  * Radio DJs looking to profanity proof their radio show playlist
  * Parents looking to profanity proof their car ride playlist
  * Students looking to profanity proof a song for a school project
  
## Response
This app actually won the "Googliest Hack" award at HackISU Fall 2016 (alongside prep4.tech) for embodying Google's mission to bring the world's information to more people, which was pretty exciting for me.
The KURE staff is thrilled!
